# Bayesian_HTE_VAR
# Author: Guangyu Tong, Jiaqi Tong, Josh Warren 
# Description: This folder includes the data analysis codes for reproducing the results presented in the paper entitled "Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of heterogeneous outcome variance in cluster randomized trials". The folder contains 3 files and documentation for each file is summarized below.
# Documentations:
1. function.R: This file contains four user-defined functions that can be used to reproduce our analysis results.
2. analysis.R: This file contains codes to reproduce our analysis results using four user-defined functions provided in function.R file and kdpp_cleaned.csv data set.
3. kdpp_cleaned.csv: This file is a cleaned version of KDPP data set used to illustrate the proposed methods. It is needed to reproduce our analysis by implementing r codes attached in this file.
